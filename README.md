# Bad-apple-in-python
Based on opencv
-----

1.Main:
  Converter to go from video -> frames -> dat file that stores the ASCII frames
2.Player:
  Player in a Tk's Label, as the print speed faster than cmd. 
  
Found this cool bad apple repo online but it didn't work for me when I tried, so I made minor changes.
I deleted the lyrics files for some reason, merged the other files and added audio.

0.dat file is premade to run with player.py 
uploading 1000+ frames didn't feel like a good idea so if you want to, just run main.py on the video
